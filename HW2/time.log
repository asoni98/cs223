----  -------  ----  --------------
9/23  2:00 pm  4:30 pm   read assignment and started looking up array structures

9/24  4:00 pm  9:00 pm   figured out arrays. started by hard coding array
                         value for required numbers and maxNumber. implemented
                         greedy and backwards
9/25  1:00 pm   8:00 pm  implemented skip and debugged thoroughly. Implemented
                         the error messages in assignment + some
                         additional ones
9/26  11:00 pm  4:50 am  This wasn't a great period of time but I felt it was
                         necessary to do the bonus. I thought of logic for opt
                         and tried to implement it. I was not successful till
                         Tuesday.

9/27  12:00 am  4:00 pm  Implemented -opt and a heuristic to make it faster

9/27  7:00 pm   8:00 pm  Implemented -opt with required numbers

I discussed parts with Alex Wang and Aadit Vyas. We mostly just shared
interesting/difficult test cases and compared the outputs of backwards, skip,
and greedy.

This program was hard initially because of a lack of familiarity with arrays in
C. I am used to being able to output an array from a function, being able to
display an array from a function, and being able to modify an array locally.
Most of the bugs in my program came from not implementing an array correctly. I
though now feel like I have a much stronger understanding of arrays. I can also
write much more effective functions. I am overall happy I did (and am done!)
with this assignment.
